# razorpay_flutter

Flutter plugin for Razorpay SDK.

## Getting Started

This flutter plugin is a wrapper around our Android and iOS SDKs.

The following documentation is only focussed on the wrapper around our native Android and iOS sdks. To know more about our sdks and how to link them within the projects, refer to the following documentation:

**Android**: [https://docs.razorpay.com/v1/page/android/](https://docs.razorpay.com/v1/page/android/)

**iOS**: [https://razorpay.com/docs/ios/](https://razorpay.com/docs/ios/)

To know more about Razorpay payment flow and steps involved, read up here: [https://docs.razorpay.com/docs](https://docs.razorpay.com/docs)

## Installation

This plugin will soon be available on Pub.

**Note**: The installation process will change once this plugin is out of alpha.

Add this to `dependencies` in your app's `pubspec.yml`

```yaml
razorpay_flutter:
  git:
    url: git://github.com/razorpay/razorpay-flutter.git
    ref: "f7ea14a"
```

**Note for Android**: Make sure that the minimum API level for your app is 19 or higher.

**Note for iOS**: Make sure that the minimum deployment target for your app is iOS 10.0 or higher. Also, don't forget to enable bitcode for your project.

Run `flutter packages get` in the root directory of your app.

## Usage

Sample code to integrate can be found in [example/lib/main.dart](example/lib/main.dart).

#### Import package 

```dart
import 'package:razorpay_flutter/razorpay_flutter.dart';
```

#### Create Razorpay instance

```dart
_razorpay = Razorpay();
```

#### Attach event listeners

The plugin uses event-based communication, and emits events when payment fails or succeeds.

The event names are exposed via the constants `EVENT_PAYMENT_SUCCESS`, `EVENT_PAYMENT_ERROR` and `EVENT_EXTERNAL_WALLET` from the `Razorpay` class.

Use the `on(String event, Function handler)` method on the `Razorpay` instance to attach event listeners.

```dart

_razorpay.on(Razorpay.EVENT_PAYMENT_SUCCESS, _handlePaymentSuccess);
_razorpay.on(Razorpay.EVENT_PAYMENT_ERROR, _handlePaymentError);
_razorpay.on(Razorpay.EVENT_EXTERNAL_WALLET, _handleExternalWallet);
```

The handlers would be defined somewhere as

```dart

void _handlePaymentSuccess(PaymentSuccessResponse response) {
  // Do something when payment succeeds
}

void _handlePaymentError(PaymentFailureResponse response) {
  // Do something when payment fails
}

void _handleExternalWallet(ExternalWalletResponse response) {
  // Do something when an external wallet was selected
}
```

To clear event listeners, use the `clear` method on the `Razorpay` instance.

```dart
_razorpay.clear(); // Removes all listeners
```

#### Setup options

```dart
var options = {
  'key': '<YOUR_KEY_HERE>',
  'amount': 100,
  'name': 'Acme Corp.',
  'description': 'Fine T-Shirt',
  'prefill': {
    'contact': '8888888888',
    'email': 'test@razorpay.com'
  },
  'external': {
    'wallets': ['paytm']
  }
};
```

A detailed list of options can be found [here](https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-gateway/integrations-guide/checkout/standard/#checkout-form).

#### Open Checkout

```dart
_razorpay.open(options);
```

#### Error Codes
The error codes have also been exposed by the `Razorpay` class.

The error code is available as the `code` field of the `PaymentFailureResponse` instance passed to the callback.

| Error Code        | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NETWORK_ERROR     | There was a network error, for example loss of internet connectivity |
| INVALID_OPTIONS   | An issue with options passed in `Razorpay.open`                      |
| PAYMENT_CANCELLED | User cancelled the payment                                           |
| TLS_ERROR         | Device does not support TLS v1.1 or TLS v1.2                         |
| UNKNOWN_ERROR     | An unknown error occurred.                                           |
